    </h1>
    <p> Creating HTML pages takes planning, but the results
        are worthwhile.
        Imagine the excitement of having your Web page seen by
        people all over the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Keep your Web pages to a few screens each.
        You can link information together, so don't worry about
        including everything at once.
    </p>
    <p> Remember that readers do not always find your home
        page first.
        A link from somewhere else can lead them to the middle of
        your information, so try not to use words like
        <br /> back<br /> forward<br /> previous<br /> next
        <br />
        to indicate navigation on your pages.

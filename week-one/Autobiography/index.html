        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            My bname is Greg and I am a math teacher at a large suburban school in Pennsylvania. 
            I have been teaching for 12 years and over that time <br>
            span, I have taught <strong>Algebra I, Albebra II, Geometry, and Statistics.</strong>
            Of those four classes, I enjoy teaching statistics the most! I am also very <br>
            involved in other school activities besides teaching. I am a volunteer coach for volleyball and soccer,
            am the advistor for the student council and <br>
            the senior class, and help to organize and maintain the food pantry for our local community.

        <h2 style="font-family: Palatino; color: purple">Personal Life</h2>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            On a personal level, I enjoy a lot of different things, I am an avid sports fan
            (of mainly football, hockey, and baseball). Since I live close to <br>
            Pittsburg I root for the <span style="color: #cab725;">Steelers and Pirates</span>. I also enjoy
            the great outdoors and frequently hike on nearby trails, mountain bike and <br>
            rock climb. I have also spent time during the summer months hiking large portions of the Appalachian trail. 
            I enjoy spending time with my family <br>
            and two kids and ofteng et together with extended family for large parties/cookouts.

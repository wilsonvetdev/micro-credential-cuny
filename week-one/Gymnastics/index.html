    <h3>History</h3>

    <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        Gymnastics developed in ancient Greece, in Sparta and Athens, and was used as method to prepare men for warfare.
        In Sparta, among the activities
        introduced into the training program was the Agoge or exhibition gymnastics made up of gymnastic elements in the
        form of the Pyrrhic-a dance in a
        military style-performed for state dignitaries in the final year of a student's training. Athens combined this
        more physical training with education of the
        mind. At the Palestra, a physical education training center, the discipline of educating the body and educating
        the mind were combined allowing for a
        form of gymnastics that was more aesthetic and individual and which left behind the form that focused on
        strictness, discipline, the emphasis on defeating
        records, and focus on strength.

        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        In the late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Germany, two pioneer physical educators –
        <strong>Johann Friedrich GutsMuths</strong> (1759–1839) and <strong>Friedrich Ludwig Jahn </strong>
        (1778–1852) – created exercises for boys and young men on apparatus they had designed that
        ultimately led to what is considered modern gymnastics.
        Don Francisco Amorós y Ondeano, was born on February 19, 1770 in Valencia and died on August 8, 1848 in Paris.
        He was a Spanish colonel, and the first person to introduce educative gymnastic in France. Jahn promoted the use
        of parallel bars, rings and high bars in international competition.

        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        The <strong>Federation of International Gymnastics <em>(FIG)</em></strong> was founded in Liege in 1881.
        By the end of the nineteenth century, men's gymnastics competition was
        popular enough to be included in the first "modern" Olympic Games in 1896. From then on until the early 1950s,
        both national and international
        competitions involved a changing variety of exercises gathered under the rubric, gymnastics, that included for
        example, synchronized team floor
        calisthenics, rope climbing, high jumping, running, and horizontal ladder. During the 1920s, women organized and
        participated in gymnastics events. The
        first women's Olympic competition was primitive, only involving synchronized calisthenics and track and field.
        These games were held in 1928, in
        Amsterdam.
    </p>

    <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        By 1954, Olympic Games apparatus and events for both men and women had been standardized in modern format, and
        uniform grading structures
        (including a point system from 1 to 15) had been agreed upon. At this time, Soviet gymnasts astounded the world
        with highly disciplined and difficult
        performances, setting a precedent that continues. Television has helped publicize and initiate a modern age of
        gymnastics. Both men's and women's
        gymnastics now attract considerable international interest, and excellent gymnasts can be found on every
        continent.

        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        In 2006, a new points system for Artistic gymnastics was put into play. With an A Score (or D score) being the
        difficulty score, which as of 2009 is based
        on the top 8 high scoring elements in a routine <del>(excluding vault)</del>. The B Score (or E Score), is the score for
        execution, and is given for how well the skills
        are performed (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, 2018).

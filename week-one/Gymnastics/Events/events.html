    <h3>Floor</h3>
    <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        Male gymnasts also perform on a 12meter x 12meter spring floor. A series of tumbling passes are performed to
        demonstrate flexibility, strength, and
        balance. Strength skills include circles, scales, and press handstands. Men's floor routines usually have
        multiple passes that have to total between <i>60â€“70</i>
        seconds and are performed without music, unlike the women's event. Rules require that male gymnasts touch each
        corner of the floor at least once during
        their routine.

    <h3>Pommel horse</h3>
    <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        A typical pommel horse exercise involves both single leg and double leg work. Single leg skills are generally
        found in the form of scissors, an element
        often done on the pommels. Double leg work however, is the main staple of this event. The gymnast swings both
        legs in a circular motion (clockwise or
        counterclockwise depending on preference) and performs such skills on all parts of the apparatus. To make the
        exercise more challenging, gymnasts will
        often include variations on a typical circling skill by turning (moores and spindles) or by straddling their
        legs (Flares). Routines end when the gymnast
        performs a dismount, either by swinging his body over the horse, or landing after a handstand variation.

    <h3>Still rings</h3>
    <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        The rings are suspended on wire cable from a point 5.75 meters from the floor. The gymnasts must perform a
        routine demonstrating balance, strength,
        power, and dynamic motion while preventing the rings themselves from swinging. At least one static strength move
        is required, but some gymnasts may
        include two or three. A routine ends with a dismount.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3>Vault</h3>
    <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        Gymnasts sprint down a runway, which is a <strong>maximum of 25 meters</strong> in length, before hurdling onto a spring board.
        The gymnast is allowed to choose
        where they start on the runway. The body position is maintained while "punching" (blocking using only a shoulder
        movement) the vaulting platform. The
        gymnast then rotates to a standing position. In advanced gymnastics, multiple twists and somersaults may be
        added before landing. Successful vaults
        depend on the speed of the run, the length of the hurdle, the power the gymnast generates from the legs and
        shoulder girdle, the kinesthetic awareness in
        the air, how well they stuck the landing and the speed of rotation in the case of more difficult and complex
        vaults.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3>Parallel bars</h3>
    <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        Men perform on two bars executing a series of swings, balances, and releases that require great strength and
        coordination. The width between the bars is
        adjustable dependent upon the actual needs of the gymnasts and usually 2m high.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3>Horizontal bar</h3>
    <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        A 2.8 cm thick steel or fiberglass bar raised 2.5 m above the landing area is all the gymnast has to hold onto
        as he performs giant swings or giants
        (forward or backward revolutions around the bar in the handstand position), release skills, twists, and changes
        of direction. By using all of the momentum
        from giants and then releasing at the proper point, enough height can be achieved for spectacular dismounts,
        such as a triple-back salto. Leather grips are
        usually used to help maintain a grip on the bar (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, 2018).

    <h1>Fish Aquariums</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>Freshwater Setup</h2>

    <p>
        A freshwater aquarium is a receptacle that holds one or more freshwater aquatic<br>
        organisms for decorative, pet-keeping, or research purposes. Modern aquariums are most<br>
        often made from transparent glass or acrylic glass. Typical inhabitants include fish,<br>
        plants, amphibians, and invertebrates, such as snails and crustaceans.
    </p>

    <p>
        Freshwater fish may be either coldwater or tropical species. Although
        freshwater
        aquariums can be set up as community tanks, coldwater and tropical
        fish are generally
        not mixed due to incompatibilities in temperature requirements.
        Coldwater aquariums
        house goldfish and other species that do not require a heating
        apparatus. Warmer
        temperatures would actually increase their metabolism and shorten
        their lifespan.
        For a tropical fish tank, maintaining a warm environmental
        temperature ranging between
        75 and 80 degrees enables the fish to thrive.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aquariums may be decorated with sand or gravel, live or plastic plants, driftwood,<br>
        rocks, and a variety of commercially made plastic sculptures. The smallest aquariums are<br>
        fish bowls, but these are not recommended for most fish as they are generally too small,<br>
        tend to stunt fish growth, and may lead to eventual death.
    </p>

    <h2>Marine Setup</h2>
    <p>
        A marine aquarium is an aquarium that keeps marine plants and animals in a contained<br>
        environment. Marine aquaria are further subdivided by hobbyists into fish only (FO),<br>
        fish only with live rock (FOWLR), and reef aquaria. Fish only tanks often showcase large<br>
        or aggressive marine fish species and generally rely on mechanical and chemical<br>
        filtration. FOWLR and reef tanks use live rock, a material composed of coral skeletons<br>
        harboring beneficial nitrogen waste metabolizing bacteria, as a means of more natural<br>
        biological filtration.
    </p>
    <p>
        Marine fishkeeping is different from its freshwater counterpart because of the<br>
        fundamental differences in the constitution of saltwater and the resulting differences<br>
        in the adaptation of its inhabitants. A stable marine aquarium requires more equipment<br>
        than freshwater systems, and generally requires more stringent water quality monitoring.<br>
        The inhabitants of a marine aquarium are often difficult to acquire and are usually more<br>
        expensive than freshwater aquarium inhabitants.
